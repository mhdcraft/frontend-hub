Welcome to Frontend Hub my personal playground for web development projects.
This repo is neatly organized into four main sections:

- 🧩 Components → Reusable UI components
- 🎨 HTML & CSS → Styling fundamentals and creative layouts  
- ⚡ JavaScript → From simple scripts to intermediate logic  
- ⚛️ React → Mini apps, and scalable UI projects  

Here you’ll find projects of different levels:  
- 🟢 Basic projects 
- 🟡 Intermediate challenges  
- 🔴 Advanced, real-world applications
- 🔵 Reusable components
